# Kinetic Ising
This is a Julia implementation of Miguel's original work in https://github.com/MiguelAguilera/kinetic-Plefka-expansions

The code is a translation of the original Python code,
rather than an interpretation following Julia style.
Nevertheless it is faster th python's version, specially using gpu 
acceleration with the Kinetic Ising model.

For an example copy the code from test.jl to julia's REPL and run it
